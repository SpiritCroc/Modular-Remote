Stuff that could or should be done.
The more x, the more important

WIP:
x   - pioneer: complete strings_tcp_commands

Fixes/Improvements:
    - no connection to ip "" (dummy connection to avoid null-pointers?)
    - if trying to add fragment to page that is null (can happen with wrong recreationKey), make error message (instead of crash?)

Upgrades / New stuff:

no coding required:
    - better featured image for play store (http://android-developers.blogspot.de/2011/10/android-market-featured-image.html)
    - more screenshots
    - feature video
    - better icon

module upgrades:
    - button: type general: home, optionsMenu, open device volume dialog, display off, fullscreen on/off, navbar on/off, pagetabs on/off (last three also as response for toggle?)
    - button: possibility: image instead of written tag (built in, external source?)
    - color options (general/per module)
    - text size (general/per module)
    - Spinner: possibility to change order
x   - Page: Use toast as display: multi-selection-list to select displays (→toast can be used for several displays)
        Example usage: use as error display
        each display: possibility to chose between Toast.LENGTH_SHORT and Toast.LENGTH_LONG

UI upgrades:
xx  - Containers: save position of fragments, on add: let user drag & drop within selected container, also replace sort fragments with drag & drop (auto sort fragments on create depending on position?)
    - dialogFragments: add to back stack (particularly when selecting commands / adding fragments)
        @Override
        public void show(@NonNull FragmentManager manager, String tag) {
            super.show(manager, tag);
            getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().addToBackStack(null).commit();//Issue: dialogs are never shown again despite being in back stack
        }
    - add landscape mode (configuration independent from portrait mode, pref in settings to only use one or both, solution for launcher shortcuts required)
        on first change: dialog: you changed orientation …bla… empty …bla… /OK /Show again next time
    - immersive mode:
        when showing systemUI elements in immersive mode, hide elements again on click somewhere else
        when showing systemUI elements in immersive mode, do not allow clicks on other UI elements (prevent sending commands by accident)
        do not allow systemUI timeout < 2 or something
        if hidden menuBar appears, make it transparent (also other stuff transparent?)
        remove experimental: test on other devices
        fix: if actionBar hidden: issues when swiping down from statusBar (swiping up from navBar works)
        fix: possible not hiding actionBar after adding page
        fix: viewPager sometimes not updating on systemUI visibility changed
    - Locked mode: hide set-up-remote-buttons (no add/edit fragment)
    - global padding settings, activity margin setting
    - Possibility to sort pages via SortFragmentsDialog (Entry in OptionsMenu?) BEWARE THE REMOVAL!
    - CustomHorizontalScrollView + CustomScrollView: make snap depending on children measured size (inspiration by ChameleonOS app sidebar)

other upgrades:
    - AddDisplayDialog: static text: add special char
        more characters in button_label_spinner_chars
        test on different APIs → don't show chars that are known to not show on certain APIs
    - possibility to specify port (just add a :portNumber to ip, e.g. :23; → read, if not given: use default)
    - first start:
        explanation how remote works
        set up block size values depending on screen size

Code style improvements:
-   move often used methods from ModuleFragments to Util

New modules:
    - ExpandableContainer:
        option: onCreate:
            always expanded
            always collapsed
            remember from last session
            collapse if content has no connected connection + expand if reconnected
    - multi-function-button (as toggleButton, but with more (n) states (and no response))
    - Slider: e.g. for volume

Functional upgrades:
    - save modules directly after adding / modifying
    - possibility to keep app on lockscreen (like locus map)
        → locked mode (no edit function)
    - option to keep screen on
x   - CommandEditor: Create chained commands (→ submenu "custom"), per RECEIVER_TYPE basis
    - Pref: remember last page
    - Option: save / load configuration
        Saves pref saved_fragments + version number → increment if module params changed


Stuff someone could add if they feel bored
    - WebViewFragment: optional actionBar with back, forward, reload-buttons (→if active, no optionsMenuEntry)
    - keyboard functionality
    - own toolbar instead of AppCompatActivity
    - infrared FB?
    - Add Help-button to Add…Dialog → ExplainDialog to explain options
    - use different icon for launcher shortcuts than for launcher (take ic_launcher and change letters M and R to P and S or S and C or something)
    - own typeface based on Roboto (get from AOSP) with special chars (play, pause, etc. → ensure visibility on all devices)
    - tasker/locale plugin to send tcp commands
    - custom widgets
    - custom notifications
