This app is still in its alpha state! This means that you should not expect a finished fully-working app, as it's still in development!

The aim of this app is to provide the user a possibility to fully create their own remote out of several modules.

Currently supported remotely control-able devices:
- Basically any device controllable via TCP, you just have to look up the commands when you set up your remote
- Advanced support for pioneer receivers (via network): Select commands & responses (not all commands & responses supported yet)
- Any device that supplies a browser-based user-interface
- Any device control-able with widgets supplied by an external app

Modular Remote is free, and open source. Visit the project on GitHub: https://github.com/SpiritCroc/Modular-Remote
If you want to help to natively support more devices, you can find out how to do so here: https://github.com/SpiritCroc/Modular-Remote/blob/master/guide_supporting_new_devices.md

Available modules:
- Button
- Toggle button
- Dropdown list
- Display
- WebView
- Widget
- Vertical and Horizontal Containers, in order to get your desired layout (you can even put containers into containers!) and enable scrolling of your modules

You can also configure multiple pages to best suit your needs depending on different occasions.
If your launcher supports creating shortcuts (like e.g. NovaLauncher), you can create home screen shortcuts to your pages.

Required Permissions:
android.permission.INTERNET: Required to access devices via TCP
android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Required to automatically connect unconnected connections on network state changed
