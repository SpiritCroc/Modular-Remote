# Modular Remote

The aim of this app is to provide the user a possibility to fully create their own remote out of several modules.  
Note it's no longer in active development, but I still use it to arrange a couple of webviews next to each other in pages, so I may push some updates every few years or so.

Modular Remote is free, and open source.
If you want to help by adding support for new remotely control-able devices, read [this guide](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/Modular-Remote/blob/master/guide_supporting_new_devices.md).
Some very old to-do list can be found [here](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/Modular-Remote/blob/master/TODO.txt).
