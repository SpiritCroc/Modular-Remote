# Modular Remote

This app is still in its alpha state! This means that you should not expect a finished fully-working app, as it's still in development!

Official Play Store site:
Become alpha tester [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.spiritcroc.modular_remote).

The aim of this app is to provide the user a possibility to fully create their own remote out of several modules.

Modular Remote is free, and open source. Contributions are welcome.
If you want to help by adding support for new remotely control-able devices, read [this guide](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/Modular-Remote/blob/master/guide_supporting_new_devices.md).
